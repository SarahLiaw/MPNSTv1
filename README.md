Sarah Liaw - SURF 2022

**07/05/22** Set up relevant csv files.
Completed first version of code for delfi+diagnosis ML model
using AdaBoost Classifier and UMAP. Trying to think of methods
to visualize how to compare different dimensionality reduction techniques.
I also need to push a couple more files.

**07/06/22** Had meeting (check SURF log hours for details).

**07/07/22, 07/08/22** Check SURF log hours.

**07/11/22** For last week's progress, check SURF log hours for
details. Concatenated files, so it goes in order of:
ID -> Diagnosis -> Tumor Fraction -> DELFI -> ichor.

**07/12/22** Visualizing dimensionality reduction methods. Check
SURF log hours.
