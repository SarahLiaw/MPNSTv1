Sarah Liaw - SURF 2022

**07/05/22 ~ 9 - 11am, 12 - 2pm, 2:30 - 6pm** Set up relevant csv files.
Completed first version of code for delfi+diagnosis ML model
using AdaBoost Classifier and UMAP. Trying to think of methods
to visualize how to compare different dimensionality reduction techniques.
I also need to push a couple more files.

**07/06/22** Had meeting (check SURF log hours for details).

**07/11/22** For last week's progress, check SURF log hours for
details. Concatenated files, so it goes in order of:
ID -> Diagnosis -> Tumor Fraction -> DELFI -> ichor.
